/*
                          const credentials = {subscriber:userId,channel: channelId}

these lines of code are creating an object named credentials that holds the userâ€™s ID and the channelâ€™s ID. This object could then be used to manage the subscription status of the user for that channel, such as adding or removing the channel from the userâ€™s list of subscriptions in the database.



                                  $push   operator
The '$push' operator is used for updating arrays in MongoDB. It lets you add new elements to an existing array within a document. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Adding Elements: '$push' inserts one or more elements to the end of the target array by default.
Creating New Array: If the field you're targeting isn't already an array, '$push' creates a new array with the specified elements.
Adding Multiple Elements: You can use the '$each' modifier with '$push' to add multiple elements at once, instead of appending the entire array as a single element.
Specifying Position (Optional): With the '$position' modifier, you can insert elements at a specific index within the array.


  


                           count the subscriber for the particular channel

To count the number of subscribers for a particular channel in your MongoDB aggregation pipeline, you can use the `$sum` operator within the `$group` stage. This operator will increment a counter each time a document matches the group criteria. Here's how you can modify your `$group` stage to include a count of subscribers:

```javascript
{
    $group: {
        _id: "$channel", // Group by the channel field
        subscriberCount: { $sum: 1 }, // Count the number of subscribers
        subscribers: { $push: "$subscriber" } // Optional: Collect subscribers' IDs
    }
}
```

In this modified `$group` stage, `subscriberCount` will hold the total number of subscribers for each channel. If you only need the count and not the list of subscriber IDs, you can omit the `subscribers` field.

Here's how your complete aggregation pipeline would look with the subscriber count:

```javascript
const subscribers = await Subscription.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            channel: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(channelId)
        }
    },
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$channel",
            subscriberCount: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            _id: 0,
            subscriberCount: 1
        }
    }
]);
```

This pipeline will give you the count of subscribers for the specified channel. If the `subscriberCount` is zero, it means there are no subscribers for that channel. You can then use this count in your response to the client, similar to how YouTube displays the number of subscribers for a channel. ðŸ˜Š
